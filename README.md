# Playfield
This is a conversion of a piece of code from the *Amiga Hardware Reference Manual - Second Printing - July 1986 (page 55)* - under the heading "examples of forming basic playfields"

Essentially it is a translation of Motorola 68000 assembly to C language code, utilising SDL2 obviously instead of banging the metal directly to display the output.

## Changelog
